/**
 * You will implement a stack that will be used to manage cars. To  implement this stack, you will use a array of pointers. 
 * That means each array element contains a pointer to an object of type car_t.
 * In order to help you manage the data structure, we have provided two global pointers. There is capacity
 * for the size of the backing array and numCars for the number of items held in the stack. You will be given
 * responsibility to change these variables as needed.
 * 
 * Note that dynamic memory allocation is required for this implementation. Itâ€™s unknown if you will have to
 * increase the size of the backing array at compilation.
 * 
 * For this stack, you shall be writing two functions
 * stack: pop_stack, and destroy_stack
 *

/**
 * \brief Variables used to track the stack.
 *
 * The two integers (capacity and numCars) represent the current 
 * maximum capacity of cars the stack can handle and the number of cars on the stack so far.
 * 
 * The pointer (stack_arr) points to the bottom of the stack, or in other words, the first element in the backing array.
 *
 * Initially, capacity is set to 5, numCars is set to 0, and stack_arr is
 * pointing the first open spot at the bottom of the stack. The stack is initially
 * empty so stack_arr is originally pointing to garbage data.

 *
 * This function will be called by client code to remove a car from the

 *
 * The way this function returns the car is using the data out technique.
 * This is to get around the limitation that functions may only have one return
 * value. As such, the caller will pass in a pointer where the car
 * should be stored. Then this function will store the returned car at that
 * pointer. Independently, it returns whether it succeeded via the normal path.
 * 
 * Finally, set the pointer of the car being popped to 'NULL' and update numCars.
 *
 * If this function succeeds, it should return `SUCCESS` and modify `*data` to
 * be pointing to the removed car. If it fails, it should return `FAILURE`
 * and leave both the stack and `*data` unchanged. It should fail if and only if:
 * * [data] is `NULL`, or
 * * the stack is empty.
